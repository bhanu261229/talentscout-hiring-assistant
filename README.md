## 🚀 Project Overview

**TalentScout Hiring Assistant** is an AI-powered chatbot that automates the initial screening of candidates for technology positions. It conducts a structured, conversational interview that:

1. **Collects candidate information** — name, contact, experience, desired role, location, and tech stack
2. **Generates tailored technical questions** — 3-5 questions per technology, adjusted for experience level
3. **Evaluates responses** in real-time with context-aware follow-ups
4. **Analyzes candidate sentiment** to gauge engagement and comfort level

The chatbot maintains full conversation context, handles off-topic inputs gracefully, and ensures a professional yet approachable screening experience.

## 💻 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- A free [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com)

### Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/talentscout-hiring-assistant.git
cd talentscout-hiring-assistant

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your Groq API key

# 5. Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

> **Note:** If you don't configure `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env`, the app will prompt you to enter it directly in the UI.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Starting a Screening Session

1. **Launch the app** — the chatbot greets you and explains the screening process
2. **Provide your information** — answer naturally; the bot collects one field at a time:
   - Full Name → Email → Phone → Experience → Desired Position → Location → Tech Stack
3. **Answer technical questions** — the bot generates 3-5 questions per technology
4. **End the conversation** — say "bye", "exit", or "done" at any time

### Sidebar Features

- **📊 Progress Bar** — tracks how much candidate info has been collected
- **👤 Candidate Profile** — live-updating card with all collected info
- **😊 Sentiment Indicator** — real-time mood detection badge
- **🔄 New Chat** — reset and start a fresh screening
- **📥 Export** — download anonymized candidate data as JSON

### Exit Keywords
The chatbot recognizes: `bye`, `goodbye`, `exit`, `quit`, `end`, `stop`, `done`, `finish`, `close`, `see you`, `later`, `that's all`, `i'm done`, and more.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit 1.30+ | Rapid prototyping with built-in chat UI components |
| **LLM** | Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) | Free tier, ultra-fast inference (~200ms), high quality |
| **Data Models** | Pydantic v2 | Type-safe data validation with JSON serialization |
| **Environment** | python-dotenv | Secure API key management |
| **Styling** | Custom CSS | Glassmorphism dark theme with Inter font |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **State Machine Pattern** — The `ConversationManager` uses an explicit state enum (`GREETING → GATHERING_INFO → TECH_QUESTIONS → ANSWERING_QUESTIONS → CLOSING → ENDED`) to ensure predictable conversation flow and prevent state corruption.

2. **Dual-Output LLM Prompting** — During info gathering, the LLM produces both a conversational response (shown to the user) and a JSON extraction block (parsed internally). This allows natural conversation while reliably extracting structured data.

3. **Context Window Management** — Full message history is passed to the LLM for context coherence. For fallback handling, only the last 6 messages are sent to keep context focused and reduce token usage.

4. **Temperature Tuning** — Different temperatures for different tasks:
   - `0.7` for general conversation (natural, varied responses)
   - `0.6` for technical questions (focused but creative)
   - `0.3` for sentiment analysis (consistent classification)

## 🧠 Prompt Design

### Design Philosophy

All prompts follow a structured template pattern with:
- **Role definition** — establishes the LLM's persona and boundaries
- **Explicit instructions** — numbered steps for the LLM to follow
- **Guardrails** — prevents deviation from recruitment purpose
- **Context injection** — dynamic data about conversation state

### Prompt Types

#### 1. System Prompt (Role-Playing + Guardrails)
```
You are TalentBot, a professional AI Hiring Assistant for TalentScout...
- NEVER deviate from recruitment purpose
- Ask for ONE piece of information at a time
- NEVER ask for passwords, SSN, or sensitive data
```
The system prompt is dynamically augmented with the current conversation state and collected candidate data.

#### 2. Information Gathering (Few-Shot + JSON Extraction)
The LLM is instructed to:
- Respond conversationally to the candidate
- Append a structured JSON block with extracted fields
- The JSON is parsed and stripped from the displayed response

#### 3. Technical Questions (Chain-of-Thought + Experience Scaling)
```
For each technology in their tech stack:
- 0-2 years: Foundational concepts
- 3-5 years: Intermediate + design decisions
- 6+ years: Advanced + architecture + optimization
```

#### 4. Fallback Handling (Redirection + Empathy)
When off-topic input is detected, the LLM acknowledges the input politely and redirects to the screening purpose with context about what needs to be collected next.

#### 5. Sentiment Analysis (Classification Prompt)
A low-temperature prompt that classifies messages into: `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`, `excited`, `nervous`, `confident` — with a confidence score.

## 🔒 Data Privacy & Security

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| **No persistent storage** | Candidate data exists only in session state (memory) |
| **Anonymized exports** | PII fields are SHA-256 hashed before JSON export |
| **Input sanitization** | All inputs stripped of injection patterns, length-limited to 2000 chars |
| **GDPR compliance** | Privacy notice displayed; only relevant data collected |
| **No logging of PII** | Utility functions never log raw candidate data |
| **API key security** | Keys stored in `.env` (gitignored), never hardcoded |
| **Exit on demand** | Candidates can end the conversation at any time |

---

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Extracting Structured Data from Natural Conversation
**Problem:** LLMs produce free-form text, but we need structured candidate fields.
**Solution:** Dual-output prompting — the LLM generates a human response + a JSON extraction block. The `extract_json_from_response()` utility parses the JSON and `strip_json_from_response()` removes it before displaying.

### Challenge 2: Maintaining Context Across Long Conversations
**Problem:** As conversations grow, context can drift or become inconsistent.
**Solution:** Full message history is injected into each LLM call, with the system prompt dynamically updated with the current state and collected data. For secondary tasks (fallback, sentiment), a trimmed context window is used.

### Challenge 3: Preventing Off-Topic Deviation
**Problem:** Users might ask unrelated questions, try prompt injection, or go off-topic.
**Solution:** Multi-layered defense: (1) System prompt guardrails forbid non-recruitment activities, (2) State-aware prompts anchor each response to the current screening phase, (3) Dedicated fallback handler redirects politely.

### Challenge 4: Making Technical Questions Relevant
**Problem:** Generic questions don't properly assess candidates.
**Solution:** Questions are generated with three context variables — tech stack, experience level, and desired position — allowing the LLM to calibrate difficulty and relevance. Temperature is set to 0.6 for focused but non-repetitive output.

### Challenge 5: Graceful Error Recovery
**Problem:** API failures, malformed responses, or edge cases shouldn't break the experience.
**Solution:** Every LLM call has try/catch wrapping that returns a friendly fallback message. JSON extraction gracefully returns `None` on parse failure. The conversation state machine prevents invalid transitions.
